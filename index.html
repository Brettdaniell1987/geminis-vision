            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>This program is for those who are lost, broken, or bound by the chains of addiction, abuse, or other forms of bondage. Our mission is to guide you to become one with the Christ mind, using mindful healing practices to not only free yourself but to become a force of healing in the world. The journey inward becomes the light outward.</p>
            <p>You are not defined by your chains. You have the power to break free from addiction, abuse, and all forms of bondage. Through mindful healing and a conscious connection to the Christ mind, we guide you to heal yourself and, in turn, to heal the world around you. Your freedom is the world's freedom.</p>
            <p>If you are feeling lost, broken, or chained by the past, you are in the right place. This program is an invitation to begin a journey of healingâ€”not just for yourself, but for the world. We will walk together, using mindful practices to connect with the Christ mind within you, so that your own liberation becomes a source of light for others.</p>
