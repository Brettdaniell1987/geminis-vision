                Surrender is the first step, but action is what sets you free. This is where we move from a decision of the heart to a life of liberation. Here, we explore the practical, intentional steps you can take to break the chains that hold you captive.

            <h2>Step 1: Identify Your Chains</h2>
            <p>
                The first step to breaking free is to understand what is holding you back. Are they chains of fear, anxiety, past trauma, or unforgiveness? Take time in quiet reflection to name them. You can't break a chain you refuse to see.

            <h2>Step 2: Act in Faith</h2>
            <p>
                Faith is not just belief; it is belief in action. Once you've identified your chains, take deliberate, faith-filled steps to break them. This could be forgiving someone, setting a boundary, or speaking your truth out loud. Every action, no matter how small, is a blow to the chains that bind you.

            <h2>Step 3: Walk in Freedom</h2>
            <p>
                Breaking a chain is a moment, but walking in freedom is a lifetime. Continually surrender your burdens to a higher power and live in gratitude for the freedom you've been given. Surround yourself with a community that supports your new life and encourages your walk.
