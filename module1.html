  <h1>Module 1: Seeing the Chains</h1>
  <p>Hello, and welcome to our path. We are so glad you are here. We're going to take our very first step together, and it's a very simple one.</p>
  <p>Imagine we are going on a gentle walk. We don't have to go fast. We don't have to be perfect. We just have to be here, together, for a little while.</p>

  <h2>What Are the Chains, Really?</h2>
  <p>Sometimes, our heart and our mind can feel a little tangled up. It can feel like we have a big ball of yarn that is all knotted. These knots are what we call "the chains."</p>
  <p>These chains aren't real, metal chains. They are things that feel heavy inside of us. Things like:
    <ul>
      <li>That whispery voice that tells you not to try.</li>
      <li>A habit that you don't like, but you don't know how to stop.</li>
      <li>A feeling of being scared, even when there's nothing to be scared of.</li>
      <li>Old memories that keep coming back and making you sad.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>These chains are not a part of who you are. They are just knots that got tangled up over time. And just like with a ball of yarn, we can untangle them, one little bit at a time.</p>

  <h2>Your First Step: Just Look</h2>
  <p>We are not going to try to break any chains today. We're just going to look at them. Think of yourself as a very kind and quiet butterfly, sitting on a leaf and just watching everything around you.</p>
  <p>When that little voice of fear comes up, just notice it. Don't be mad at it. Don't try to make it go away. Just say softly to yourself, "There is that chain of worry."</p>
  <p>By just looking at it without judgment, you are already making it a little less tangled. You are creating a little bit of space between you and the chain.</p>

  <h2>Your Simple Tool: The Chain Log</h2>
  <p>To help you with this first step, we have a very simple and kind tool. It's just a notebook and a pen. We call it your "Chain Log."</p>
  <p>When you notice a chain—that voice, that worry, that feeling—write it down. Don't write a long story. Just a few simple words. For example:
    <ul>
      <li>"Feeling worried about money."</li>
      <li>"Thought about what someone said a long time ago."</li>
      <li>"Feeling of not being good enough."</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>This little notebook is your private place. No one else has to see it. It's just a way to help you notice the chains without being pulled around by them.</p>

    <h3>Ready for the next step?</h3>
    <p>This first module is about awareness, not perfection. When you feel ready, you can move on to the next module. There is no rush.</p>
