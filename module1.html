            <h2>Module Goal</h2>
            <p>To introduce participants to mindful awareness and compassion, creating a peaceful space within themselves from which to begin their healing journey.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>You Are a Safe Space:</strong> The first step isn't about fixing anything, but about realizing that peace and safety can be found within.</li>
                <li><strong>The Power of Observation:</strong> We will teach that you don't have to believe every thought or feel every emotion fully. You can simply notice it, like watching a cloud pass by. This is the foundation of freedom.</li>
                <li><strong>Small Acts of Kindness:</strong> Healing starts with tiny, consistent acts of kindness toward oneself.</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>The "Daily Blessings" Journaling Prompt</h3>
                <p><strong>The Practice:</strong> Each morning or evening, find a quiet moment and a piece of paper or a notebook. Your only job is to write down **three things** you are grateful for from your day. This simple act is an expression of the Christ mindâ€”a recognition of the divine blessing in your life.</p>

            <div class="practice">
                <h3>The Mindful Breath Meditation</h3>
                <p><strong>The Practice:</strong> Find a comfortable position and gently close your eyes. Simply notice the rhythm of your breath without judgment. The breath is your anchor; it is always there, and you can always return to it. This practice creates a feeling of groundedness and inner peace.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="practice">
                <h3>The "Kindness Check-In" Practice</h3>
                <p><strong>The Practice:</strong> Pause once a day and ask yourself, "What is one small, kind thing I can do for myself right now?" This could be drinking a glass of water, stretching, or simply giving yourself a moment of silence. This practice teaches you to intentionally choose kindness towards yourself.</p>
