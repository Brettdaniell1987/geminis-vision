            <h2>Module Goal</h2>
            <p>To help participants release the chains of anger and resentment toward others, allowing them to reclaim their inner peace and spiritual freedom.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Forgiveness as Self-Liberation:</strong> Forgiveness is a radical act of self-love that releases you from the bondage of past hurts.</li>
                <li><strong>The Power of Surrender:</strong> This is a conscious, humble choice to let go of the need to control the past or to change others. It's an act of faith that frees you to live in the present.</li>
                <li><strong>The Grace of Letting Go:</strong> Letting go of resentment creates a space for grace, peace, and new possibilities to enter your life.</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>The Forgiveness Letter Ritual</h3>
                <p><strong>The Ritual:</strong> Write a detailed letter to the person who hurt you, pouring all your feelings onto the page. At the end, declare your choice to forgive them, not for them, but for you. Then, in a safe space, burn the letter and watch as the words and the hurt turn to ash. This is an act of liberation.</p>

                <h3>The "Release" Meditation</h3>
                <p><strong>The Practice:</strong> In a guided meditation, visualize a burden or resentment as a heavy stone. See a warm light from your heart surround the stone. With a long, slow exhale, imagine releasing the stone and watching it dissolve into light. This practice helps you mentally and emotionally release the weight of the past.</p>

            <div class="practice">
                <h3>The Practice of the Humility Prayer</h3>
                <p><strong>The Practice:</strong> Choose a moment each day to repeat this simple prayer: "I release my need to control this. I release my hurt. I surrender this to a higher grace. I am free." This daily prayer reinforces your choice to surrender and helps you remain unburdened.</p>
