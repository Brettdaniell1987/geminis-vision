  <h1>Module 3: The First Gentle Tug</h1>
  <p>Hello again, brave friend. You have done so well. You have learned to see the chains, and you have learned to find a little space for yourself. That is an incredible achievement.</p>
  <p>For this module, we are going to take the smallest, kindest action you have ever taken. We're not going to try to break anything. We are just going to try to loosen one tiny knot. It's a bit like a gentle tug on a single thread from that tangled ball of yarn.</p>

  <h2>Choosing One Knot to Untangle</h2>
  <p>Look at your "Chain Log" from Module 1. You have a list of all the things that have felt heavy inside of you. Look at that list, not with judgment, but with kindness.</p>
  <p>Your only job is to pick one very small chain to focus on for a little while. This isn't a life-long commitment. It's just for today, or for this week. Pick a chain that feels like a small, loose knot, not a big, tight one. We want to start with something easy.</p>
  <p>For example, if you wrote down "Feeling worried about the future," a smaller, gentler knot might be "worrying about what will happen this afternoon."</p>

  <h2>Your Simple Tool: A Tiny Act of Change</h2>
  <p>Your tool for this module is a tiny act of change. It is so small you might not even feel it.</p>
  <p>Let's say the small knot you chose was "worrying about what will happen this afternoon." A tiny act of change might be to simply say to yourself, "For the next five minutes, I will choose to think about a happy memory instead."</p>
  <p>That is all. You are not trying to stop the worry forever. You are just choosing to create a very tiny distraction for a very tiny amount of time. And in that choice, you are taking back a little bit of your power.</p>
  <p>You can do this with any small chain. The act itself doesn't matter. What matters is the act of choosing to do something, no matter how small.</p>

  <h2>The Power of a Gentle Tug</h2>
  <p>By choosing one small knot to work on, you are not trying to solve the entire problem. You are simply learning that you can take action. You are learning that you have a choice. And in that learning, you are beginning to trust yourself again.</p>

  <div class="next-step">
    <h3>Ready for the next step?</h3>
    <p>Practice this gentle tug on one small chain this week. When you feel ready, you can move on to the next module. There is no rush at all.</p>
