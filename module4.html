            <h2>Module Goal</h2>
            <p>To help participants embody love and light in their daily lives, using their personal healing to become a source of healing for others.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your Healing is the World’s Healing:</strong> Your personal transformation is not just for you. Every time you break a chain, you send a ripple of healing into the world.</li>
                <li><strong>Love as an Action:</strong> "Walking in love" is a daily, conscious choice—in how you speak, how you listen, and how you respond to the world around you.</li>
                <li><strong>The Path of the Light-Bearer:</strong> You are a light-bearer, someone who has found their own light and now shares it to help others find theirs.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="practice">
                <h3>The "Legacy" Practice</h3>
                <p><strong>The Practice:</strong> This is an act of creation. Find a quiet space and reflect on what "walking in love and light" means for you. Create a Legacy Vision Board or write a single paragraph Legacy Statement that declares who you are now and how you will embody your new life.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="practice">
                <h3>The "Daily Act of Light" Practice</h3>
                <p><strong>The Practice:</strong> Each morning, make a commitment to perform one small, intentional act of love or light before the day is over. This could be a genuine compliment, a kind text, or simply offering a moment of quiet, compassionate thought for someone in need.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="practice">
                <h3>The "Light-Bearer's" Meditation</h3>
                <p><strong>The Practice:</strong> In a final guided meditation, visualize a radiant light in your heart. See this light expanding beyond you, touching everyone you know, and becoming a source of healing for the world. This practice helps you see that you have become a beacon of light.</p>
