  <h1>Module 4: Your Inner Strength</h1>
  <p>Hello, and welcome to our final module. You have come so far. You have looked at your chains, you have found a little space for yourself, and you have taken the first gentle tugs. It is time to honor the incredible strength you have found inside yourself.</p>
  <p>This module is not about being "fixed." It is about a new understanding: that you are not broken. You have learned that your chains may still be there sometimes, but you now have the tools to be free from them, whenever you need to be.</p>

  <h2>The Chains are Not Gone</h2>
  <p>Some of the chains will fall away, and some may remain. This is not a failure. This is part of being human. A worry might come back, or an old habit might tug at you again. This is not defiance from the world; it is just a moment for you to practice your tools again. A moment for you to be kind to yourself.</p>

  <h2>Your Final Tool: A Kind Voice</h2>
  <p>Your final tool on this path is a very powerful one. It is a kind voice. And that voice is yours.</p>
  <p>When you feel a chain tug at you, instead of getting upset or angry with yourself, practice speaking to yourself as you would to a dear child.
    <ul>
      <li>"It's okay that you feel worried. It's okay."</li>
      <li>"I see that this is hard, but you are strong."</li>
      <li>"You have the tools to handle this, and you will be fine."</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>That kind voice is the most powerful tool you have. It is the voice of your own inner strength. It reminds you that no matter what comes your way, you will be there to pick yourself up again, gently and with love.</p>

  <h2>The End is a Beginning</h2>
  <p>You have finished the modules, but this is not the end of your journey. It is a new beginning. You now have the knowledge and the tools to walk your own path, at your own pace. You have learned to trust yourself. And that is a peace no one can take away.</p>

  <h1>A Note on Your Continued Journey</h1>
  
  <h2>Our Mission: A Path to Peace</h2>
  <p>Our mission is simple: to help you discover inward peace that does not depend on the approval or validation of others. It is a peace that comes from within you, for you.</p>

  <h2>On Failing and Rising Again</h2>
  <p>The journey to inward peace is not a straight line. There will be days when the old chains feel heavy again. There will be moments when you feel you have failed.</p>
  <p>This is not a sign of weakness. This is a sign of your strength. To fail and to rise again is the greatest part of the journey. Every time you feel you have stumbled, you are being given an opportunity to practice the most important tool of all: radical self-compassion.</p>
  <p>Extreme confidence in yourself does not mean you never fall. It means you know, with absolute certainty, that no matter how many times you fall, you will always be there to pick yourself up again. You have the tools, you have the awareness, and you have the strength to do it with kindness every single time.</p>
  <p>The path is not a destination. The path is you. And you are enough.</p>
