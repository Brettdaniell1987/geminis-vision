                You have reached the end of my formal teachings, but this is not the end of your journey. This is where your personal walk of faith truly begins.

            <h2>A Final Message to You</h2>
            <p>
                My prayer for you is simple: that you continue to surrender, to find strength in the fight, and to walk in the freedom you have found. The path may not always be easy, but you are not walking it alone.

            <h2>Pass It On: Share Your Truth</h2>
            <p>
                The greatest act of faith is to share your story. What you have learned and overcome can be the light that guides someone else out of the darkness. Your testimony is a powerful link in the chain that is being broken for others.

                Your journey is meant to be shared. Connect with others on a similar path and find support, encouragement, and prayer as you continue to grow.
