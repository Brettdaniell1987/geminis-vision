  <h1>Module 2: Finding a Little Space</h1>
  <p>Hello again. You have done such a brave and kind thing by looking at your chains in Module 1. That was the most difficult step, and you did it. Take a quiet moment now to thank yourself for that.</p>
  <p>For this module, we're not going to try to break the chains. We are just going to learn how to create a little bit of space between ourselves and them. We're going to create a quiet place to stand, just for ourselves.</p>

  <h2>Your Hands, Your Heart, Your Chain</h2>
  <p>Imagine a chain. It is not a part of your hand, but it is in your hand. If you hold it very, very close to your heart, it can feel like it is a part of you. It feels heavy and it feels painful.</p>
  <p>This module is about learning to hold that chain out at arm's length. It is still there, but it is not touching your heart. It has no power over you when you give it space.</p>

  <h2>Your Simple Tool: A Gentle Pause</h2>
  <p>We are going to give you your second simple tool. It's called "A Gentle Pause."</p>
  <p>When you feel a chain tugging at you—a worry, a fear, or a difficult memory—your only job is to stop for a moment. You don't have to change anything. Just pause. It's a bit like a butterfly landing on a flower for a moment before flying on.</p>
  <p>For just two slow breaths, stop what you are doing. Don't think about the chain. Just think about your breathing. One breath in. One breath out. A second breath in. A second breath out.</p>
  <p>That is all. That tiny moment of pausing is all you need to create a little bit of space. That is your second tool. You can use it as often as you need it.</p>

  <h2>The Power of a Little Space</h2>
  <p>This isn't about being perfect. This is about being gentle with yourself. You are not trying to be a superhero. You are simply learning that you are not your chains. And in that little bit of space, you will find your own peace.</p>

    <h3>Ready for the next step?</h3>
    <p>Practice "A Gentle Pause" this week. When you feel ready, you can move on to the next module. There is no rush at all.</p>
