            <h2>Module Goal</h2>
            <p>To help participants gently identify their mental chains (negative thought patterns) and replace them with the unconditional love and compassion they would offer others.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identifying the Inner Critic:</strong> The first step is to recognize the inner voice that holds you in bondage—the voice of shame, fear, and self-doubt.</li>
                <li><strong>The Voice of Christ as a Compassionate Witness:</strong> The voice of Christ is not one of judgment, but of compassionate observation. It simply witnesses the critic's words without believing them.</li>
                <li><strong>Radical Self-Forgiveness:</strong> True self-love is an act of forgiveness—releasing yourself from the bondage of past mistakes and shame.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="practice">
                <h3>The "Observer's Notebook" Practice</h3>
                <p><strong>The Practice:</strong> For seven days, simply become a quiet observer of your thoughts. Jot down any recurring negative or critical thought you hear in your mind, without trying to change it. This practice builds the crucial muscle of awareness without judgment.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="practice">
                <h3>The "Christ Mind Response" Practice</h3>
                <p><strong>The Practice:</strong> Take a critical thought you've identified and write a loving and compassionate response to it from the perspective of the Christ mind. This practice actively builds a new, compassionate voice within you, one that offers truth and grace instead of judgment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="practice">
                <h3>The "Yes" and "No" Practice</h3>
                <p><strong>The Practice:</strong> This week, identify one small thing you can say "no" to that drains you, and one small thing you can say "yes" to that nourishes you. This is a practical act of self-love that protects the healing you have already begun.</p>
