            <p class="intro">
                Surrender isn't about giving up; it's about letting go. It's the courageous act of releasing your burdens, your fears, and your need for control, and placing them in the hands of a higher power. This path leads not to defeat, but to profound freedom and peace.

            <h2>What Surrender Truly Means</h2>
            <p>
                True surrender is an active, ongoing choice. It is the decision to trust in a wisdom greater than your own, even when the path ahead is unclear. It's about accepting that you are not alone in your struggles and that there is a purpose for your pain.
            </p>
