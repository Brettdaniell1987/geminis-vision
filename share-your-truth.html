Key elements in this code:

<form action="/submit-truth" method="post">: This is the main container for the form.
action="/submit-truth": This is where you'll point to your back-end script that handles the form data.
method="post": This is the standard way to send form data securely.
<fieldset> and <legend>: These tags group related form elements, making the form easier to read and more accessible.
<textarea>: This element creates the large text box for the user's story.
rows and cols attributes set the initial size.
required means the user must fill this out to submit the form.
<input type="text">: A single-line text input for the user's name.
<input type="radio">: These create the "Yes/No" options for notification. The key is that they share the same name attribute (notify-preference), which ensures a user can only select one.
<input type="email">: This is a specific type of input that helps with validation by only accepting an email format.

<button type="submit">: The button that sends all the form data to your back-end script.
