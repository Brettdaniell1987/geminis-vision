            <h2>The Fight is a Sign, Not a Sentence</h2>
            <p>
                When you choose to walk in your truth and surrender your life to a higher power, you are no longer a passive target. You become a light, and the darkness will inevitably push back. The opposition, the doubts, the sudden hardshipsâ€”these are not signs of your failure. They are proof that you are a threat to what holds others captive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every attack meant to discourage you is, in fact, a powerful affirmation that you are on the right path. You are a chosen one, and your struggle is a testament to the power within you.

                How do you stand firm when the enemy strikes?
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reframe the Narrative:</strong> Stop seeing every setback as a defeat. Instead, see it as a confirmation that you're making progress.</li>
                <li><strong>Lean on Your Faith:</strong> The fight is a chance to deepen your trust. When your own strength falters, it creates space for your higher power to work.</li>
                <li><strong>Connect with Community:</strong> Remember you are not fighting this battle alone. Share your struggles and draw strength from others who have faced similar opposition.</li>

            <h2>Your Fight is Not in Vain</h2>
            <p>
                Your story of battling and breaking free from spiritual opposition is a powerful weapon. By sharing your truth, you confirm the power of your faith and inspire others to see their own fight as a confirmation.
